Jotdown
=======

Markdown-like syntax for taking notes. Jotdown is:

* Pretty in plaintext
* Easily and quickly typable while, say, taking a class
* Version-controllable
* Ünì©ôðé-friendly
* Translatable to HTML, but theoretically to anything else
* Capable of parsing some elements of math formulas for pretty output with human-readable syntax
